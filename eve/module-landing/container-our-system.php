                 Their task is to check the events that are created in the application, and they hold the
                 capability on whether to approve or decline these events. Some events are organized by the
                 department, so they are also given the ability to create events.</p> -->

                   about guests and their details. Their role is to take note of the visitors’ check-in time by clicking the “Check-in” button
                   once the ID pass has been given to the visitors. For more accurate data, it is also part of their
                   duty to mark a guest’s check-out time by clicking the “Check-out” button once the

                   <li><span class="purple font-weight-bold">I.T. department</span> as  <span class="purple font-weight-bold">Supervisor</span></li>
                   <p>Improvement and maintenance of the system must be given utmost importance aside from its development,
                     and this would be possible with the assistance of the IT department. </p>
